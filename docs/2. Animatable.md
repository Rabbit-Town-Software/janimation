# Animatable

The `Animatable` interface defines the contract for any object that wants to be animated.

---
## Overview

Your game entities (players, NPCs, objects, etc.) implement this interface so that JAnimation knows where they are and how to draw frames.

---
## Methods

```java
float getX()
```

Returns the **X position** of the object in world or pixel space.

---

```java
float getY()
```

Returns the **Y position** of the object in world or pixel space.

---

```java
void drawFrame(
Graphics2D g, 
BufferedImage frame, 
int x, int y, 
int width, int height)
```

Called by the animation system to draw the current frame.

You normally do **not** call this method yourself as it will be invoked automatically by the `Animator`.

**Parameters**
- `g` – Graphics2D context to draw on
- `frame` – The current animation frame image
- `x`, `y` – Position in pixels (after world/camera offset)
- `width`, `height` – Render size in pixels

---
### Example

```java
// Creating a class that implements Animatable
public class Player implements Animatable
{
    private float x, y;

	// Create Getters
    @Override
    public float getX()
    {
        return x;
    }

    @Override
    public float getY()
    {
        return y;
    }

	// Draw the player
    @Override
    public void drawFrame(
    Graphics2D g, 
    BufferedImage frame, 
    int x, int y, 
    int width, int height)
    {
        g.drawImage(frame, x, y, width, height, null);
    }
}
```
