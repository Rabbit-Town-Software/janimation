# AnimationLoader

Utility for loading and caching animation frames from resources.

---
## Overview

Handles `BufferedImage` caching so images arenâ€™t reloaded repeatedly.

---

## Static Methods

#### *Use this if your entity only has one animation*

```java
BufferedImage[] loadFrames(String[] paths)
```

Loads multiple frames from resource paths into an array.
Use this if your entity only has one animation or effect.
### Example

```java
// Load the frames
BufferedImage[] playerIdleNorthFrames = AnimationLoader.loadFrames(
	new String[]
	{
		"assets/player/idle/north/playeridlenorth01.png",
		"assets/player/idle/north/playeridlenorth02.png",
		"assets/player/idle/north/playeridlenorth03.png",
		"assets/player/idle/north/playeridlenorth04.png"
	});
// Now playerIdleNorthFrames is just a raw array of BufferedImage objects

// The player object must implement Animatable!
Player player = new Player(0, 0); // This is just an example

// Instantiate the animator and player for playing the frames
Animator playerAnimator = new Animator();
playerAnimator.setFrameDuration(1000); // 1000ms per frame

// Now you can play the frames using the animator
// We will talk further on the Animator later in the documentation.
playerAnimator.animate(
	playerIdleNorthFrames,  // The raw frames
	true,                   // Loop forever
	player,                 // The entity being animated
	graphics,               // Your Graphics2D context
	0,                      // No camera offset for X
	0,                      // No camera offset for Y
	32);                    // Size to render (32px)
```

#### *Use this if your entity has multiple animations and you want to manage them by name using an AnimationController*

```java
Map<String, BufferedImage[]> loadNamedAnimations(Map<String, String[]> animations)
```

Loads a map of animation names and an array of paths into memory.
### Example 1: Full Setup

```java
// Load all animations for the player in one call
Map<String, String[]> playerAnimationPaths = Map.of
(
    "IdleNorth", new String[]
    {
		"assets/player/idle/north/playeridlenorth01.png",
		"assets/player/idle/north/playeridlenorth02.png",
		"assets/player/idle/north/playeridlenorth03.png",
		"assets/player/idle/north/playeridlenorth04.png"
    },
    "WalkNorth", new String[]
    {
		"assets/player/walk/north/playerwalknorth01.png",
		"assets/player/walk/north/playerwalknorth02.png",
		"assets/player/walk/north/playerwalknorth03.png",
		"assets/player/walk/north/playerwalknorth04.png"
    }
);

// Load the animations into memory
Map<String, BufferedImage[]> playerAnimations = AnimationLoader.loadNamedAnimations(playerAnimationPaths);

// The player object must implement Animatable!
Player player = new Player(0, 0); // This is just an example

// Create a controller for switching animations
AnimationController playerAnimationController = 
	new AnimationController(player, playerAnimations);

// Start by switching the controller to "IdleNorth"
playerAnimationController.play("IdleNorth");

// Retrieve the current frames from the controller
BufferedImage[] playerCurrentFrames =  
	playerAnimationController.getCurrentAnimation();

// Instantiate the animator for playing the frames
Animator playerAnimator = new Animator();
playerAnimator.setFrameDuration(1000); // 1000ms per frame

// Play the frames using the animator
playerAnimator.animate(
    playerCurrentFrames,    // The raw frames (from controller)
    true,                   // Loop forever
    player,                 // The entity being animated
    graphics,               // Your Graphics2D context
    0,                      // No camera offset for X
    0,                      // No camera offset for Y
    32                      // Size to render (32px)
);
```

### Example 2: A More Straightforward Setup

```java
// The player object must implement Animatable!
Player player = new Player(0, 0); // This is just an example

// Directly wire controller and loader together
AnimationController playerAnimationController = 
	new AnimationController(player, AnimationLoader.loadNamedAnimations(Map.of(
		"IdleNorth", new String[]
		{
			"assets/player/idle/north/playeridlenorth01.png",
			"assets/player/idle/north/playeridlenorth02.png",
			"assets/player/idle/north/playeridlenorth03.png",
			"assets/player/idle/north/playeridlenorth04.png"
		},
		"WalkNorth", new String[]
		{
			"assets/player/walk/north/playerwalknorth01.png",
			"assets/player/walk/north/playerwalknorth02.png",
			"assets/player/walk/north/playerwalknorth03.png",
			"assets/player/walk/north/playerwalknorth04.png"
		}
    )));
    
// Start by switching the controller to "IdleNorth"
playerAnimationController.play("IdleNorth");

// Retrieve the current frames from the controller
BufferedImage[] playerCurrentFrames = 
	playerAnimationController.getCurrentAnimation();

// Instantiate the animator for playing the frames
Animator playerAnimator = new Animator();
playerAnimator.setFrameDuration(1000); // 1000ms per frame

// Play the frames using the animator
playerAnimator.animate(
    playerCurrentFrames,    // The raw frames (from controller)
    true,                   // Loop forever
    player,                 // The entity being animated
    graphics,               // Your Graphics2D context
    0,                      // No camera offset for X
    0,                      // No camera offset for Y
    32                      // Size to render (32px)
);
```

## Internals

- Uses a ConcurrentHashMap cache to avoid reloading images  
- Logs load results with java.util.logging
